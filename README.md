The Open Combatant System is a wargaming system that will be built off of modules, and provides a frameowrkf for building any kind of wargame from various time periods and wiht different rules. These modules can be combined to make a fully functioning wargame, that allows you to pit steampunk aristocratic gangs against alien nova tech agents.

A core aim of the rules system is that you can bring whatever minatures you want and be able to apply rules to make a cohesive ruleset for the army to play against someone else.
